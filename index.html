  <h2> Mission Statement </h2><br>
  <h4> My name is Ross Rawlings, I am a senior at Hanford Highschool. Last year I was enrolled in the tri-tech skills center <br>
         computer science/cyber security program. I hope to go into the computer/electrical engineering field. I hope to join <br>
          the nuclear engineering programin the navy and I am working towards my future everyday! <br>
             The Tri-Cities has all kinds of amazing S.T.E.M. jobs, hopefully after my time in the navy<br>
               I will be able to find one that fits me well.</h4>
  <h2>Special Skills </h2>
  <h4>During my enrollment at Tri-Tech I have learned many things. One thing I learned was how to install operating systems <br>
       like Windows, Debian, Centos, and Ubuntu. During this course Mr. Coleman taught us more things than I can list, like DHCP server <br>
         configuration, Soldering, Website design and Database management. I have also worked with bread boards to make controllers for a LED <br>
           ring(see below picture). I am very excited to learn about my future career field. I was lucky enough to secure an internship at Energy Northwest, specifically<br> 
    their Nuclear power station. While I was at CGS, I learned the importance of procedure use and human performance. When you are working with materials that<br>
    can seriously harm you, it is very important to do the work in a safe manor. I was responsible for making procedures that plant operators <br>
    use to manipulate the plant. I hope to bring some of the keys to success that I learned at CGS with me <br>
    to my furture employment and my everyday life. Another thing I learned during my internship was time management. My supervisors<br>
    expected the same out of me as they expeced from the rest of the emplyees. Many of the tasks I did were from other groups, so my <br>
    supervisor did not know what I was doing, but she expected me to be on time, with quality work.
